## 1⃣️ The development process
***Artificial intelligence technology*** has been around since the 1950s. It was first developed in 1955: Newell and Simon created a program called **"Logic Theor."** However, the term ***"AI"*** wasn't coined until 1956 at the Dartmouth Society
## 2⃣️ Recent development
Over the last 60 or 70 years, AI technology has evolved a lot. But its key technologies are still in the hands of tech giants, making it almost impossible for ordinary people to access them.
## 3⃣️About us
Now, the ***"MOX Project"*** is going to change that and provide more opportunities for people who love robotics and AI technology (which means that the project is completely free and open source). But it requires more support and help **(not financial)**, and it doesn't require any basic programming (just writing simple dialogues).
